## SHADOWOGRAPHY – DREW COLBY

Drew Colby has worked with puppets in the UK and Southern Africa for over 30 years.  His first professional work started at the Playhouse Puppet Company at Durban, South Africa.  Work spanned traditional double bridge, long string marionette shows, open stage tabletop puppetry, and performances with mixed styles of puppetry, acting, mask work, and dance.  
He later returned to work in the UK at the Little Angel Theatre, notably alongside Steve Tiplady, which led him to start exploring ‘ instant puppetry’ where there are no purpose built puppets – only objects brought to life.  This in turn led him to shadow work where the theatre is created out of the absence of light, the puppeteers ability, and the audience’s imagination – ‘the ultimate instant puppetry’.
Drew has travelled across the globe performing shadows in addition to creating shadow sequences for Danny Boyle, Nintendo, B&Q, Lodotra, Suso, the RSPB, BBC, Channel 4, V&A Museum, and The Royal Opera House.

## MADEMOISELLE LYCHEE – AYA NAKAMURA

Probably the smallest burlesque dancer in the world.
Watch as she embarks with the audience into a sensual and glamorous world of corset, feather, velvet and stain silk leaving you either horrified or laughing at the end of your unforgettable experience.

Aya is a Japanese theatre-maker, puppeteer, and puppet maker who is based in London.  She has created many shows for the Rouge 28 Theatre, who’s primary interest lies in puppetry for adult audiences.


## PATSY MAY – LAURA BACON

She’s sassy, funny and brings a whole load of attitude into all her endeavours.
   
Patsy May is performed by Laura Bacon a gifted singer, writer, and puppeteer.
