## THE LIPS BY PUPPETS WITH GUTS 

A dazzling & surreal big puppet outdoor sing along, The LIPS are a chorus of delightfully deviant divas whose mouths have escaped from their bodies! The LIPS reanimate our favourite songs, celebrate our shared love of popular music and uphold our freedom to speak out, through a pop-puppetry performance that is seductive yet subversive. The LIPS are highly expressive, they change colour at nighttime and are best performed after sunset as a musical finale show stopper for festivals or events.

Puppets with Guts is a daring big puppet theatre company. Puppets with Guts are devisers of dazzling big puppet theatre experiences that inspire and delight. We animate and inhabit outdoor and unusual spaces through spectacular creative adventures that surprise and captivate our audiences. We create spectacular shows for outdoor events and festivals and provide professional services in puppetry, creative consultation and design and making for theatre, corporate events, film and television.

TOYBOX is about taking experiences, playing with them and putting them back together with a better understanding.

## I MADEMOISELLE LYCHEE – AYA NAKAMURA
