            <h2>The Pop-Up Palladium</h2>
            <p>The Pop-Up Palladium is a live streamed virtual puppet theatre.  Our unique line-up of acts will whisk you away from the climate of doom and gloom on a magical mystery tour of nostalgic laughter and a trip into the otherworldly.</p>
            <p>With theatres having been left out in the cold by lockdown easing, and TV productions being slow to start up, the future looking very bleak for puppeteers who usually work in close proximity.</p>
            <p>The Pop-Up Palladium lets you enjoy the hilarity and beauty of puppetry from the comfort of your own home while giving you a  behind-the-scenes look into the full spectrum of puppetry in Theatre and TV by talking to the people working professionally in this artform in the UK and abroad.</p>
            <p>The Pop-Up Palladium is sponsored by The Curious School Of Puppetry and Talk To The Hand Puppets.</p>
            <h2>Supporting Puppeteers</h2>
            <p>We are the waggle! We passionately believe in the power of puppetry to bring fantasy creatures and worlds to life, providing windows into unique worlds for audiences to enjoy escaping into.</p>
            <p>The pandemic has had a devastating effect on the Arts across the board and puppeteers are no exception although often forgotten about.</p>
            <p>The Pop-Up Palladium is a new place where puppets perfom and puppeteers talk about their work.  It was conceived as a way to help puppeteers across the whole spectrum of puppetry showcase their work and for audiences to watch and learn about the different approaches to this rich and varied art form.</p>
            <p>Buy a ticket to welcome puppets and puppeteers into the warmth of your home and allow your new friends to open up their world to you.</p>
            <p>The money we raise will be split between the acts in each show -  we donâ€™t want people who have seen all their income evaporate to perform for free - with a portion kept back as a rolling fundraiser to help support other puppeteers in performing to deprived communities.  We want this new and and exciting platform to support the  artists and communities most in need through these challenging times of isolation and fear</p>
