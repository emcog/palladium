## SHADOWOGRAPHY with Drew Colby

Drew Colby has worked with puppets in the UK and Southern Africa for over 30 years. His first professional work started at the Playhouse Puppet Company at Durban, South Africa. Work spanned traditional double bridge, long string marionette shows, open stage tabletop puppetry, and performances with mixed styles of puppetry, acting, mask work, and dance.
						
He later returned to work in the UK at the Little Angel Theatre, notably alongside Steve Tiplady, which led him to start exploring ‘instant puppetry’ where there are no purpose built puppets – only objects brought to life. This in turn led him to shadow work where the theatre is created out of the absence of light, the puppeteers ability, and the audience’s imagination – ‘the ultimate instant puppetry’.
Drew has travelled across the globe performing shadows in addition to creating shadow sequences for Danny Boyle, Nintendo, B&Q, Lodotra, Suso, the RSPB, BBC, Channel 4, V&A Museum, and The Royal Opera House.
